#### voice-tampering-detection

## Title:	Identifying the voice tampering, where a Mic is attached through WSN. 

# Four basic types of tampering include: 

1) Deletion - the elimination of words or sounds by stopping the tape and over-recording unwanted areas. 
2) Obscuration - the mixing in of sound of amplitude sufficient to mask wave form patterns which originally would show stops and starts in inappropriate places. 
3) Transformation - the rearranging of words to change content or context. 
4) Synthesis - the adding of words or sounds by artificial means or impersonation.
