## Title:	Identifying the voice tampering, where a Mic is attached through WSN. 

#### Four basic types of tampering include: 

1) Deletion - the elimination of words or sounds by stopping the tape and over-recording unwanted areas. 
2) Obscuration - the mixing in of sound of amplitude sufficient to mask wave form patterns which originally would show stops and starts in inappropriate places. 
3) Transformation - the rearranging of words to change content or context. 
4) Synthesis - the adding of words or sounds by artificial means or impersonation. 

#### Methods used to Detect Falsifications and Authenticate Tape Recordings: 

##### 1) Critical Listening: 
Use of human analytical capabilities to locate anomalies. The forensic scientist listens with proper headphones to the original tape using high quality analytical equipment. He first performs a preliminary overview of the original tape and notes recorded events including starts, stops, speed fluctuations, and other variations requiring further investigation. He then examines record events and categorizes them as environmental or non-environmental. After examining any anomalies, the expert analyzes background sounds. He listens for abnormal changes, absences, or differences in environmental sounds. The final phase of critical listening is an extensive audit of the foreground information. He concentrates on voices, conversation and other audible sounds. Here anomalies include sudden changes in a person's voice, abrupt unexplained topic change, or strong foreground interruptions indicative of obscuration. The initial forensic process of critical listening provides foundation and direction for later intensive tests. 

##### 2) Physical Inspection: 
The forensic expert next inspects for tampering with a thorough visual inspection of the tape itself. He inspects the housing for pry marks, welding, size, label and date consistent with alleged recording date. He also measures the tape and assures the splicing of magnetic tape to the leader is consistent with normal manufacturing process. Any other splices are noted as possible alteration. 

##### 3) Magnetic Development: 
Direct visual observation of the magnetically "developed" tape is conducted to find track widths, the type of recorder used, and the presence or absence of residual speech signals. 

##### 4) Spectrum Analysis: 
Specialized computer equipment and programs to produce a visual interpretation of a frequency-versus-amplitude and frequency-versus-amplitude-versus-time displays. This allows the expert to view the entire spectrum or to zoom in on an area of particular interest thereby helping to characterize the acoustic quality of anomalies and identify their source. 

##### 5) Waveform Analysis: 
A computer generated display representing time-versus-amplitude of recorded sounds in graphic form. With such analysis the expert can sometimes measure signal return time which reveals how long a recorder had been turned off. He can identify record-mode including the measurement of record-to-erase-head distances, determination of the spacing between gaps in multiple-gap erase heads, and inspection of the signature shape and spacing of various record event signals. 

##### 5) Recorder performance: 
Various electrical and mechanical measurements of standard and modified recorders for use in finding possible origins of buzz sounds, hum, etc.
